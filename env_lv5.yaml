# Lvl 5: Hardest. A narrow, winding "S-shaped" maze that forces multiple turns.
# This environment is designed to test advanced sampling strategies like
# Gaussian (bridge) sampling and adaptive step size.

bounds:
  x: [0, 50]
  y: [0, 50]
  z: [0, 50]

# Using 6 drones for a significant dimensionality challenge in a tight space.

obstacles:
  # --- The S-shaped Maze Walls (very tall to prevent flying over) ---

  # Wall 1: Forces drones to go through the upper passage (high Y values)
  - type: box
    position: [15, 15, 25] 
    size: [4, 30, 50]
    color: red

  # Wall 2: Forces drones to go through the lower passage (low Y values)
  - type: box
    position: [30, 35, 25]
    size: [4, 30, 50]
    color: blue

  # --- Additional obstacles to make the path non-linear and more difficult ---

  # Cylinder inside the first turn, narrowing the passage
  - type: cylinder

  # Sphere inside the second turn
  - type: sphere

    radius: 3.0
    color: orange

  # A final barrier before the goal, forcing another deviation
  - type: box
